However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets main_design_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1_main_design_clk_wiz_0_0] >

	Clock Rule: rule_gclkio_mmcm_1load
	Status: FAILED
	Rule Description: An IOB driving a single MMCM must both be in the same clock region if CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE=BACKBONE is NOT set

	main_design_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clkin1_ibufgds (IBUFDS.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y146
	main_design_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X1Y2

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_mmcm_bufg
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: An MMCM driving a BUFG must be placed on the same half side (top/bottom) of the device
	main_design_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKFBOUT) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X1Y2
	main_design_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clkf_buf (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y31

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
