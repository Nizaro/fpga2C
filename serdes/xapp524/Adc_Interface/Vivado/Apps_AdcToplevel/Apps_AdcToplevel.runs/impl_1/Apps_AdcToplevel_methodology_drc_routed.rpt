2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Adc_DI_0_0_n_pin relative to clock(s) AdcBitClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Adc_DI_0_0_p_pin relative to clock(s) AdcBitClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Adc_DI_1_0_n_pin relative to clock(s) AdcBitClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Adc_DI_1_0_p_pin relative to clock(s) AdcBitClk

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Adc_FCLK_0_p_pin relative to clock(s) AdcBitClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock IntMmcm_SysClk1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 10 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins Apps_AdcToplevel_I_AppsClock/MmcmClock_I_Mmcm_Adv/CLKOUT1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock IntMmcm_SysClk1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 9 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins Apps_AdcToplevel_I_AppsClock/MmcmClock_I_Mmcm_Adv/CLKOUT1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock IntMmcm_SysClk3 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins Apps_AdcToplevel_I_AppsClock/MmcmClock_I_Mmcm_Adv/CLKOUT3]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#4 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock IntMmcm_SysClk3 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 8 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins Apps_AdcToplevel_I_AppsClock/MmcmClock_I_Mmcm_Adv/CLKOUT3]
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#1 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
Apps_AdcToplevel_I_AdcToplevel/AdcToplevel_I_AdcClock/AdcClock_I_Isrds_Master: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
