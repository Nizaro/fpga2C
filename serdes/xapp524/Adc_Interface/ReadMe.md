## OVERVIEW

This "readme" describes how to use the contents of the zip file, how and with what tool the
designs are made and what to do to obtain from/about the design.

### ReadMe files in the design Hierarchy
  *A md file is a Markdown text file.*
  *It can be opened with a normal editor, as if it was a txt file.*
  *Opening it in a markdown reader or in a web browser provides better readable layout.*
**PLEASE**: Read the "...ReadMe...md" files in the different folders.

## SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- Xilinx Vivado_2017.4 or higher.
- QuestaSim_10.5d or higher

## USED DESIGN ENTRY TOOLS.

- Atom text editor (www.atom.io)

## DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY.

REMARK: The reference design is only available in VHDL.

## REMARKS:
No remarks.

## Folders
### /Constraints
XDC constraints file in order to put the design in teh FPGA of a KC705 development board.
WHen the design is used as part of a customized design, one must create an own XDC file
and make sure timing and placement are met.

### /Libraries
Each of the directories in a /Libraries directory is set up as a stand alone project
with its own documentation, simulation, and sometimes implementation. The goal is that
these smaller designs can be used as standalone design or as component in other designs.
The structure of a library is therefore the same as that of a design at a higher
hierarchical level.
  ```
    /<Library name>_Lib
        +-- /Documents		Documents about the library content.
        +-- /Simscripts		Simulation scripts for the library.
        +-- /Simulation		Simulation tool work directory
        +-- /Vhdl            Source code of the library. More later on.
  ```
Example of a library setup and use:
  ```
    /Libraries
        /AdcClock_Lib
        /AdcData_Lib
            +-- /Documents		    Documents about the library content.
            +-- /Simscripts         Simulation scripts of the design in the library.
            +-- /Simulation         Used by the simulator to store compiled models.
            +-- /Vhdl
            |    +-- AdcData.vhd            File used in the design (Data treatment pipe).
            |    +-- AdcData_Toplevel.vhd   Design that can be used to implement this part.
            |    +-- AdcData_Testbench.vhd  Test bench for the AdcData design.
            |    +-- AdcData_Checker.vhd    Used by the simulation as data checker.
            |    +-- AdcData_Tester.vhd     Stimuli for the test bench of AdcData.
            |    +-- AdcData_Vec.txt        Vector text file read by AdcData_Tester.
            |    +-- AdcDataCheck_Vec.txt   File written by AdcData_Checker (results).
        /AdcFrame_Lib
        /AdcMem_Lib
        /.....
  ```
### /SimScripts
- Read the *Readme_Simulation.md* file in order to know how to start and simulate the design.
- Each library folder contains a *Readme_Simulation.md*.
- Contents:
  ```
   /SimScripts
      <Design_Name>_FuncSim.do      TCL command file for QuestaSim to run the simulation.
      <Design_Name>_FuncWave.do     File called by the ..._FuncSim.do file. Contains the
                                    signals to display as waveforms.
      Readme_Simulation.md          Instructions how to run the simulation.
      transcript                    File generated by QuestaSim.
                                    Contains all executed commands.
  ```

### /Vhdl
Here the HDL source code of the design is stored.
The directory contains not only the hardware source code but also all the files needed
for simulation of the design, except the simulation scripts stored in /SimScripts.
```
The design:
	AdcToplevel.vhd
The files needed for simulation:
	AdcToplevel_Testbench.vhd	Toplevel test bench including all components
	AdcToplevel_Tester.vhd		Sets the input control pins of the ADC
	AdcToplevel_Checker.vhd		Checks the output of the simulation
	Ads6445_Tester.vhd			Mimicking of an ADC
Input and output file for/from the simulation:
	AdcInVec.txt
	AdcOutVec.txt
	AdcRead_Vec.txt
	AdcReadCnst_1_Vec.txt
	AdcReadCnst_2_Vec.txt
Implementation of the top level design with only ADC inputs.
	AdcToplevel_Toplevel.vhd
Implementation of the toplevel design with a small application:
	AdcIo.vhd
	Apps_AdcToplevel.vhd
```

## REVISION DETAILS.
  - 19 Aug 2012
      Release of the original design.
  - 10 Jan 2016
      Design upgraded to Vivado_2017.3
  - 15 Feb 2018
      Design completely reviewed, updated, simulation ported to QuestaSim and
      Synthesis and implementation upgraded to Vivado_2017.4 or later.
  - 25 May 2018
      Applied some changes to AdcFrame_Lib/Vhdl/AdcFrame.vhd.
      Increased the bitslip watch counter by one for all resolution widths. Now there
      are effectively 8-bitslips possible. With the old counter size only seven bitslips
      were accounted for.
      Changed the behavior of the re-sync. When the bitslip counter goes out of range 
      the design needs to restart from zero. That process was combinatorial and is now
      a registered process. The re-sync also triggers a full reset of the design what makes 
      it more robust.

Kind regards,

xilinx
